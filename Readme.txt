This is an Excel tool (with VBA) to track a portfolio of structured products like autocalls and phoenix notes.

It helps follow key info: market levels, barriers, observation dates, and coupons.  
The dashboard updates automatically, shows alerts with colors, and gives a clear summary of the portfolio.

I built it to practice and better understand the daily work of a sales in structured products.
